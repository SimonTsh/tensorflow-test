# tensorflow-test

#### Browser Setup
There are two main ways to get TensorFlow.js in your browser based projects:

Using script tags.

Installation from NPM and using a build tool like Parcel, WebPack, or Rollup.

If you are new to web development, or have never heard of tools like webpack or parcel, we recommend you use the script tag approach. If you are more experienced or want to write larger programs it might be worthwhile to explore using build tools.
